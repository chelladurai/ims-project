Releasing Heroku CLI
====================

[CircleCI will handle releases](https://circleci.com/gh/heroku/cli). Pushing to master automatically will release to the beta channel if the tests are successful. Tagging with a version number will release to stable.

Release to dev channel by pushing to the `dev` branch. Add other dev channels by adding a channel to circle.yml

Instructions:

* Run [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np)
* Update [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/heroku/cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG).
* CircleCI will detect the tag and automatically release to stable
* Homebrew:
```
